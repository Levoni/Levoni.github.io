            <div>Hello! I am a full stack developer based in Wisconsin.</div>
            <br>
            <div>From a young age, I've had an inquisitive mind and enjoyed problem solving. This has extended to multiple area's of my life but none more so than technology and the creation of software. This has led to me learning different technologies and working on several projects on my own time.</div> 
            <br>
            <div>While studying at the University of Wisconsin - Platteville I acquired valuable skills and techniques. After graduation, I started working at Experity on their medical practice management software. I have continued to learn and improve my abilities and will continue to do so in the future.</div>
